### 🗑️ Garbage Overflow Detection using YOLOv8 🚀  

This project uses **YOLOv8** to detect overflowing garbage bins and send alerts. It processes video feeds in real-time using a trained object detection model.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Detects garbage bins and identifies overflowing waste.  
✅ Uses **YOLOv8** for object detection.  
✅ Processes video feeds from webcams or CCTV cameras.  
✅ Can be integrated with alert systems (SMS, notifications).

## 🔧 Setup Instructions  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/garbage-overflow-detection.git
cd garbage-overflow-detection
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Download the Dataset & Model  
We use **Roboflow** to manage datasets. To download, first install the API:  
```bash
pip install roboflow ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib
```
Then, modify `waste_detection.py` with your **Roboflow API key** and dataset details.  

```python
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")  
project = rf.workspace().project("YOUR_PROJECT_NAME")  
dataset = project.version("1").download("yolov8")
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Detection Script  
Run the YOLOv8 model on your webcam or video feed:  
```bash
python waste_detection.py
```

## 🎥 How It Works  
1. Captures video from your webcam (or file).  
2. Runs YOLOv8 object detection on each frame.  
3. Identifies overflowing garbage bins.  
4. Displays detections and highlights full bins.

## 🛠️ Customize & Improve  
Want to make it better? Try these:  
✨ Train a custom YOLOv8 model with more images.  
🔗 Integrate SMS/email alerts when bins overflow.  
🌡️ Deploy on a Raspberry Pi for real-world use.
